-- Part 5.1 — Cross-Format Queries (DuckDB)
-- All queries read directly from raw files; no pre-loading.
-- File paths assume the working directory contains:

-- ============================================================


-- Q1: List all customers along with the total number of orders they have placed

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM read_csv_auto('customers.csv') AS c
LEFT JOIN read_json_auto('orders.json') AS o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;


-- Q2: Find the top 3 customers by total order value

SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_order_value
FROM read_csv_auto('customers.csv') AS c
JOIN read_json_auto('orders.json') AS o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_order_value DESC
LIMIT 3;


-- Q3: List all products purchased by customers from Bangalore

SELECT DISTINCT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category
FROM read_csv_auto('customers.csv') AS c
JOIN read_json_auto('orders.json') AS o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN read_parquet('products.parquet') AS p
    ON o.order_id = p.order_id
WHERE c.city = 'Bangalore'
ORDER BY p.product_name;


-- Q4: Join all three files to show: customer name, order date, product name, and total price

SELECT
    c.name            AS customer_name,
    o.order_date,
    p.product_name,
    p.total_price
FROM read_csv_auto('customers.csv') AS c
JOIN read_json_auto('orders.json') AS o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN read_parquet('products.parquet') AS p
    ON o.order_id = p.order_id
ORDER BY o.order_date, c.name;
